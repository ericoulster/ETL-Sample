This is an example of a live ETL script I made which transferred bank data packaged in a JSON file into an Azure-based SQL Server
The ETL accounts for omitted tables in the data. It also accounts for what type of form is sent, based on one of 4 configurations.
The service I build this ETL for has since been discontinued, and the credentials/password variables have been scrubbed.
